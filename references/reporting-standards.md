# Reporting Standards: NI 43-101, JORC, CRIRSCO

## The relationship between them

CRIRSCO (Committee for Mineral Reserves International Reporting Standards) sets the international template that national/regional codes are harmonized against. NI 43-101 (Canada), JORC (Australasia), SAMREC (South Africa), PERC (Europe), and SEC S-K 1300 (US) are all CRIRSCO-family codes — they share the same core resource/reserve category definitions (Measured/Indicated/Inferred; Proven/Probable) and the same core principle: **public disclosure of mineral resources/reserves must be prepared or supervised by, and signed off by, a suitably qualified and experienced person** (terminology differs by code — see below).

| Code | Jurisdiction | Sign-off role | Common trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| **NI 43-101** | Canada (applies to any company listed on a Canadian exchange, wherever the project is) | Qualified Person (QP) | Any public disclosure of scientific/technical info about a mineral project |
| **JORC Code** | Australia / New Zealand (ASX-listed companies) | Competent Person (CP) | Public reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources, Ore Reserves |
| **SAMREC** | South Africa | Competent Person | JSE-listed companies |
| **S-K 1300** | United States (SEC) | Qualified Person | SEC-registered companies |

They differ mainly in disclosure mechanics and terminology, not in the underlying resource/reserve philosophy. If a user asks "what's the difference between NI 43-101 and JORC," the honest answer is: for the categories and general framework, very little — the practical differences are in specific disclosure requirements, the exact sign-off/liability regime, and local regulatory filing mechanics.

## What a Qualified/Competent Person sign-off actually means

The QP/CP isn't a formality — they take personal professional responsibility for the technical accuracy of the disclosure and typically must be a member of a recognized professional association with relevant experience in the specific style of deposit being reported on. When Claude drafts report language for a user, it should never present itself or its output as a substitute for this — always frame drafted technical reports as *inputs for review by the project's actual QP/CP*, not as a compliant filing on their own.

## Typical NI 43-101 Technical Report structure (useful skeleton for any code)

1. Summary
2. Introduction
3. Reliance on other experts
4. Property description and location
5. Accessibility, climate, local resources, infrastructure, physiography
6. History
7. Geological setting and mineralization
8. Deposit types
9. Exploration
10. Drilling
11. Sample preparation, analyses, and security (QA/QC)
12. Data verification
13. Mineral processing and metallurgical testing
14. Mineral Resource estimates
15. Mineral Reserve estimates (if applicable)
16. Mining methods
17. Recovery methods
18. Project infrastructure
19. Market studies and contracts
20. Environmental studies, permitting, social/community impact
21. Capital and operating costs
22. Economic analysis
23. Adjacent properties
24. Other relevant data
25. Interpretation and conclusions
26. Recommendations
27. References

Not every report needs all 27 sections in full — a PEA-stage report will be thin on sections 15–17 (Reserves, detailed mining/recovery) and heavier on section 3's disclaimer language about Inferred material and lack of certainty. Match the depth of each section to the actual project stage rather than padding out sections with no real content.

## Regional standards beyond the "big three"

The table above covers the most commonly referenced CRIRSCO-family codes. Three more come up often enough in cross-border evaluation work to warrant their own notes:

### Brazil

Brazil doesn't have a single dedicated CRIRSCO-member reporting code in the same mold as NI 43-101 or JORC; disclosure practice for Brazilian projects (especially by companies dual-listed or seeking international capital) generally aligns with CRIRSCO principles directly, or with whichever home-market code the listing company is subject to (e.g., a TSX-listed company with a Brazilian project still reports under NI 43-101). Brazil is a major producer of iron ore and niobium (see `references/metals/niobium-tantalum.md`) among others, and ANM (Agência Nacional de Mineração) is the relevant domestic regulatory body for permitting and mineral rights — distinct from, and not a substitute for, CRIRSCO-family technical reporting compliance. When evaluating a Brazil-domiciled project, check which reporting code the company's listing actually requires, rather than assuming a Brazil-specific equivalent exists.

### Russia — GKZ classification (A/B/C1/C2)

Russia (and some other post-Soviet states) historically use(d) the **GKZ** (State Commission on Mineral Reserves) classification system, with categories **A, B, C1, C2** (roughly ordered from highest to lowest geological confidence, plus separate exploration-stage categories). This is a genuinely different system from CRIRSCO's Measured/Indicated/Inferred/Reserve framework — it was developed independently, uses different criteria for category boundaries (historically more prescriptive about drill spacing by deposit type than CRIRSCO's principle-based approach), and **does not map cleanly one-to-one onto CRIRSCO categories**. Treat the two systems as distinct frameworks that both describe geological confidence, rather than assuming a fixed conversion rule between them.

If a user needs a GKZ-reported resource represented under a CRIRSCO-family code (e.g., for international disclosure), that reclassification is a substantive technical exercise requiring an actual Qualified/Competent Person to re-evaluate the underlying data against CRIRSCO criteria — it is not a lookup-table conversion, and Claude should not present one. Flag clearly that this is an area of genuine industry disagreement and that any specific category correspondence claimed for a project needs professional sign-off, not a general rule.

### South Africa — SAMREC

SAMREC (South African Mineral Resource Committee) code is JSE-listed companies' equivalent framework, following the CRIRSCO template closely (Competent Person sign-off, Measured/Indicated/Inferred and Proved/Probable categories defined consistently with the CRIRSCO family). It's commonly relevant for platinum group metals, gold, manganese, and coal projects in Southern Africa. Because SAMREC is a close CRIRSCO-family cousin of JORC and NI 43-101, most of the general guidance in this file applies directly — the main practical difference to flag is which regulator/exchange the disclosure is being made to (JSE) and which professional body's membership qualifies someone as a SAMREC Competent Person.

## Language for uncertainty/disclaimers (important, don't drop this)

Any report that includes Inferred Resources in economic analysis (i.e., a PEA) must carry language along these lines: *"the PEA is preliminary in nature, includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA will be realized."* This isn't boilerplate to skip — regulators specifically require it, and omitting it is a real compliance gap Claude should flag if drafting or reviewing a PEA-stage document.
